## What is The Odin Project?
[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) it's a fullstack course made by the community and open-source. In this repository I'll save all my projects that I will do through the course.

## Why didn't you separate the proyects into repositories?
I wanted to organize everything related to the course in one repository. Here you'll find *very* basic projects made with just plane HTML, because they are part of the course, and I didn't want to have an individual repository just for and `index.html` and `styles.css`.

## Did you make this projects? Or just copied the code from the course?
I made them. What I like about this course is that they give you an idea and some guidance about how to achieve the final product, but you have to write the 100% of the code but yourself, pretty cool right?

## Can I contribute?
This repository is intended to showcase the projects that the course proposed, so accepting contributions this time feels like *cheeting*. If you want to contribute to any of my other projects go ahead!
