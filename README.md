## ðŸ›‘ Important ðŸ›‘
I decided to move each project to an individual repository, you can find some of them in [this](https://github.com/stars/alesbe/lists/cool-js-proyects) list. Im leaving this repository public just to keep the commit history!

## What is The Odin Project?
[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) it's a fullstack course made by the community and open-source. In this repository I'll save all my projects that I will do through the course.

## Did you make this projects? Or just copied the code from the course?
I made them, 100% of the code! What I like about this course is that they give you an idea and some guidance about how to achieve the final product, but you have to write the 100% of the code by yourself, pretty cool right?

## Can I contribute?
This repository is intended to showcase the projects that the course proposed, so accepting contributions this time feels like *cheating*. If you want to contribute to any of my other projects go ahead!

## Project index
If you didn't see the project link [here](https://alesbe.github.io/the-odin-project/) is another one!
*Note: Usually projects escalate in complexity, so normally each project will be more interesting to watch than the previous one!*

- **Recipies**: A plain HTML site featuring 3 recipies divided in multiple files.
- **Landing page**: A landing page prototype made with pure HTML and CSS.
- **Rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock**: Awesome game made with pure JavaScript. Just go and enjoy.
- **Etch-a-Sketch**: If you've like the last one, you're gonna love this one. I had so much fun making this and also learned a lot. 100% recommended!
- **Calculator**: A vanilla JS calculator inspired by the iOS calculator design. [Here](https://github.com/alesbe/react-native-ios-calculator) is a more accurate design that I made with React Native.
